Manual Workflow Registry for Prefect Deployment

This file contains the manual registry of all workflows that can be deployed.
Developers MUST add their workflows here after creating them.

This approach is required because:
1. Prefect cannot deploy dynamically imported flows
2. Docker deployment needs static flow references
3. Explicit registration provides better control and visibility
