FuzzForge is a security research orchestration platform. Use these tools to:

1. **List hub servers**: Discover registered MCP tool servers
2. **Discover tools**: Find available tools from hub servers
3. **Execute hub tools**: Run security tools in isolated containers
4. **Manage projects**: Initialize and configure projects
5. **Get results**: Retrieve execution results

Typical workflow:
1. Initialize a project with `init_project`
2. Set project assets with `set_project_assets` — path to the directory containing
   target files (firmware images, binaries, source code, etc.)
3. List available hub servers with `list_hub_servers`
4. Discover tools from servers with `discover_hub_tools`
5. Execute hub tools with `execute_hub_tool`

Skill packs:
Use `list_skills` to see available analysis pipelines (e.g. firmware-analysis).
Load one with `load_skill("firmware-analysis")` to get domain-specific guidance
and a scoped list of relevant hub servers. Skill packs describe the methodology —
follow the pipeline steps while adapting to what you find at each stage.

Agent context convention:
When you call `discover_hub_tools`, some servers return an `agent_context` field
with usage tips, known issues, rule templates, and workflow guidance. Always read
this context before using the server's tools.

Artifact tracking:
After each `execute_hub_tool` call, new output files are automatically tracked.
Use `list_artifacts` to find files produced by previous tools instead of parsing
paths from tool output text. Filter by source server or file type.

File access in containers:
- Assets set via `set_project_assets` are mounted read-only at `/app/uploads/` and `/app/samples/`
- A writable output directory is mounted at `/app/output/` — use it for extraction results, reports, etc.
- Always use container paths (e.g. `/app/uploads/file`) when passing file arguments to hub tools

Stateful tools:
- Some tools require multi-step sessions. Use `start_hub_server` to launch
  a persistent container, then `execute_hub_tool` calls reuse that container. Stop with `stop_hub_server`.
